                What is Discrete Math and how is it related to Computer Science?<br/>
                By definition, according to <i>Wikipedia</i>, Discrete Math is <br/>
                "the study of mathematical structures that are fundamentally dis- <br/>
                 crete rather than continuous." In simpler terms, it applies logic<br/>
                 as well as compressed terms to mathematics. In Discrete Math there<br/>
                 are similarties you will be able to relate to coding logic. The basic<br/>
                 prerequisites for Discrete Math tend to be, some level of coding exposure<br/>
                 and mathematics either to Algebra 2 or Pre-calculus. Explore the links<br/>
                 above to find out the basics and of Discrete Mathematics.<br/></p>
